    <p>This is a tool to help Eos programmers learn how to touch type on an eos console, in the style of computer keyboard touch typing resources that I used as a child. Simply set it going and just follow the command line prompts!</p>
    <p>To use this tool make sure your computer and console are on the same network and have compatible IP's and then open <a href="Mavis Eos v2.esf2" download>this showfile</a> into Eos. Once your PC and Console are on the same LAN and have matching subnets, input the IP of the computer you are running this on into the <i>OSC UDP TX Address</i> box under Setup > System > Show Control > OSC, making sure OSC TX is on and the OSC UDP TX port is set to 8001. </p>
    <p>If you are using this on the same PC as Eos, input the loopback IP address of 127.0.0.1</p>
    <p>This is very much a work in progress, but click the button below and have fun!</p>
    <p><b>This software is provided as-is without warranty. I do not recommend use on any large networks or consoles that have any way of controlling fixtures. I take no responsibility for anything that may arise if that does occur.</b></p>
